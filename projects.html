								<p>There are a few instances where I did projects out of my official academia journey, some while working as a research assistant, a freelance 
									UX Developer (working for the university), and many when I was actively participating in hackathons. Here is a brief outline of the projects 
									I will showcase in this page.

							<h2>Research Assistant and Freelance Projects</h2>
								<div class="row">
									<p class="justified">I have done quite a few projects while I was in university. All of them are affiliated to the university 
										in a way but when I was in Malaysia, all of them have external collaborators which I interact with as my clients (people who I am developing 
										for). To have a coherent understanding of what I've done, I classified the projects I've done via the clients.
									</p> 
									
									<h3>Baba Nyonya Heritage Museum</h3>
									<p class="justified">
										I have lots of fun developing interactive exhibits for the Baba Nyonya Heritage Museum. For context, the Baba Nyonya Heritage Museum in Malacca, Malaysia 
										documents the local history of the "Peranakans" - the ethnic group of early chinese migrants who married the locals in the 14th-17th century. I started 
										working with them during my Final Year Project in my undergraduate, where I developed a <a href="academia.html" target="_blank">conductive paint poster</a>. 
										The museum enjoyed working with us and I then continue assisting a PhD student to develop two additional interactive exhibits, a blacksmith simulator and a 
										"batu boh" (stone grinder) simulator. Both of these interactive exhibits are multi-sensory experiences, both having visual, auditory and tactile feedback, 
										while the latter even scent feedback and physical rewards.

										
									</p>


									<p class="justified">
										The augmented reality system developed through my research will give fans unprecedented access to detailed stats, 
										including player highlights and analysis of in-game performance. Through this technology, sports fans can enjoy a more personalized 
										fan experience that will keep them engaged as they watch their favorite teams play. Furthermore, by providing an entertaining 
										way for spectators to stay connected with the game, it is our goal to increase attendance at sporting events by making 
										stadiums more exciting places for people of all ages and backgrounds. </p>

									<p class="justified">
										Throughout my PhD, I developed 2 frameworks, one called the "3'C's Situated Visualization Design Guidelines" and the "Flexible XR Prototyping 
										Framework". Both of these are findings from the experience I have obtained in developing sports AR. I also developed multiple prototypes, each with 
										specific use-case in different medium, ranging from mobile phones to VR HMDs. I also conducted 4 user studies as part of my PhD, with a couple more as 
										part of my research assistant job which I will detail in the <a href="projects.html">projects</a> section.</p>

									If you are interested in that research, feel free to read my 
									<a href="https://visualcomputing.otago.ac.nz/pdfs/LoWeiHongPhDs.pdf" target="_blank">PhD Thesis</a>
									to get a better idea of what I have done, or visit <a href="https://arspectator.otago.ac.nz" target="_blank">the ARSpectator website</a>.
									Embedded above is a quick video of the overall concept and a glimpse of the various prototypes developed.

								<h2>Undergraduate Research</h2>

								<div class="row">
									<p class="justified">I graduated with my bachelor's degree from the University of Nottingham (Malaysia Campus) in 2017 with a first class honours 
										in Software Engineering. It was during that time that I developed my interest in Human Computer Interaction (HCI). Shortly after graduating, I 
										participated in an interview and got offered a job at Intel as a System-on-Chip design engineer, in which I declined as the field did not 
										interest me. Since then I was working with my supervisor in the University of Nottingham on <a href="projects.html">various projects</a> 
										focusing on UX, before finally pursuing my PhD in the Univeristy of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand.
										</p>
									<p class="justified">During my undergraduate studies, there were two large scale projects that I did, one as a group project, while the other
										was an individual project. The group project was in collaboration with an industry partner called 
										<a href="https://tentacletech.com/" target="_blank">Tentacle Technologies</a>. They were a software engineering service provider
										offering product developement, research and developement, software engineering and testing, etc. At that time, we were working with them to 
										create a job portal prototype. I was involved in the whole process from the requirement gathering phases where we interviewed the client, all the 
										way to the development of the website prototype. Throughout the project, I've learn how to develop project plans, write the 
										Systems Requirement Specifications document, define functional and non-functional requirements, create wireframe prototypes before finally
										developing and testing the web prototype we created. At that time, we were using an agile development methodology and I was the scrum master 
										leading my team. Apart from the standard HTML, CSS and JS, we used Foundation 6 Framework for our frontend, PHP with CodeIgniter alongside MySQL for
										our backend and database.
