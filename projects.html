								<p>There are a few instances where I did projects out of my official academia journey, some while working as a research assistant, a freelance 
									UX Developer (working for the university), and many when I was actively participating in hackathons. Here is a brief outline of the projects 
									I will showcase in this page.

									<p class="justified">I have done quite a few projects while I was in university. All of them are affiliated to the university 
										in a way but when I was in Malaysia, all of them have external collaborators which I interact with as my clients (people who I am developing 
										for). To have a coherent understanding of what I've done, I classified the projects I've done via the clients.

									<h3>Baba Nyonya Heritage Museum</h3>

									<p class="justified">
										I had a fantastic experience developing interactive exhibits for the Baba Nyonya Heritage Museum, located in Malacca, Malaysia. The museum is dedicated 
										to preserving the local history of the Peranakans, an ethnic group of early Chinese migrants who intermarried with locals between the 14th and 17th 
										centuries. I began working with the museum during my undergraduate final year project, where I developed a <a href="academia.html" target="_blank">
										conductive paint poster</a>. This initial collaboration led to further opportunities to assist a PhD student in creating two additional multi-sensory 
										interactive exhibits: a goldsmith simulator and a "batu boh" (stone grinder) simulator.
									</p>
									<p class="justified">
										The goldsmith simulator provides an authentic and engaging experience by incorporating actual hardware components, such as a blowtorch foot pump. 
										We embedded sensors in the foot pump to detect pressure and used a Leap Motion sensor to track users' hand movements. Participants follow on-screen 
										instructions to virtually create a pendant, selecting their desired frame and coin, weighing the materials, and using the blowtorch to solder the 
										pendant together. My role in this project primarily involved evaluating the system, while also contributing to brainstorming sessions and project 
										discussions.
									</p>
									<p class="justified">
										The "batu boh" stone grinder simulator aimed to recreate the traditional grinding process while teaching users about the role of the stone grinder in Peranakan 
										cuisine. We collaborated with a stage set craftsman to create a custom-made, realistic replica of the grinder. I designed blueprints to accommodate the 
										necessary hardware components, which included a Raspberry Pi with an RFID reader and infrared sensors to detect grinder rotation. After several iterations, 
										we achieved a visually authentic grinder that provided a semi-realistic grinding interaction suitable for all ages.
									</p>
									<p class="justified">
										Users engage with the exhibit by inserting RFID cards representing different ingredients in the correct sequence and grinding for a specified duration. 
										Upon completion, they receive a toy capsule containing a sticker depicting a local cake based on the chosen ingredient combination. This sticker can be 
										exchanged for a real sample of the cake at the museum cafe. Throughout the experience, voice narration guides users, and a puff of vanilla scent 
										enhances the immersive atmosphere upon completion of the grinding process. For this exhibit, I was involved in all aspects, from designing the grinder 
										and contributing to code development, to conducting user testing at the museum.

									<h3>River of Life Outreach Program</h3>
									<p class="justified">
										The River of Life Outreach Program is an educational initiative affiliated with the Malaysian government, designed to raise awareness about the importance 
										of rivers and their protection. This program is a collaborative effort with Asia Pacific Environmental Consultants Sdn Bhd (ASPEC) and focuses on creating 
										interactive exhibits tailored for the general public, with a particular emphasis on engaging the younger generation.
									</p>
									<p class="justified">
										In this project, my supervisor and I collaborated to develop two interactive exhibits. The first exhibit was inspired by the conductive paint poster I previously 
										mentioned in my work for the Baba Nyonya Heritage Museum. The second exhibit introduced a new experience, incorporating RFID tags, LED light strips, miniature 
										landscape models, and animation videos. By integrating these innovative and immersive elements, we sought to foster a deeper understanding and appreciation for 
										rivers and their conservation among visitors. Our goal was to encourage responsible environmental stewardship through engaging and educational experiences.

												<figcaption class="centercaption">The interactive landscape model we created attached to a monitor for playing video.</figcaption>
											</figure>	
										</span>
									</div>
									<p class="justified">
										The first interactive exhibit we designed was an intricate landscape model that depicted a section of the riverbank, complete with commercial and industrial areas, 
										as illustrated in the image above. To create the base of the model, we carefully carved a block of styrofoam using specialized styrofoam cutters. We also embedded
										a Raspberry Pi and LED strips under the styrofoam that acts as indicators and feedback to guide user attention to a specific area. We then adorned 
										the landscape with a combination of arts and craft materials, as well as miniature toy models, to bring the little town to life.
									</p>
									<p class="justified">
										In addition to the commercial and industrial zones, the model also showcased an area where deforestation was taking place, highlighting the negative impact of 
										human activities on the environment. Furthermore, we incorporated an interactive area that utilized RFID cards and a reader, allowing visitors to engage with the 
										exhibit in a dynamic and immersive manner. This combination of visual and interactive elements aimed to educate visitors about the importance of preserving our 
										rivers and the surrounding ecosystems.
									</p>
									<p class="justified">
										The exhibit features an attached monitor that displays various issues affecting the river, which are linked to numbered RFID cards. Users can select a card, 
										scan it on the reader, and observe the corresponding area in the landscape model light up. The monitor then plays an animation we created that illustrates 
										the specific problem. Following the animation, the screen prompts users to choose the correct solution for that particular issue using the RFID cards. If the user 
										selects the right solution, the area in the landscape model lights up, and another video demonstrates how that solution effectively addresses the problem. However, 
										if an incorrect card is scanned, the unrelated section of the landscape lights up, and the screen encourages users to try another card. This interactive experience 
										not only educates visitors about the challenges faced by the river ecosystem but also engages them in problem-solving, fostering a deeper understanding of the 
										potential solutions and their impact on the environment.

									</div>
									<p class="justified">
										The other interactive exhibit I've done is a reinforced version of the <a href="academia.html" target="_blank">conductive paint poster</a> I've developed before.
										From past experience, we realised that users, especially children tend to touch the poster with force. This time, we created the posters with wood and printed 
										large stickers to stick on them. The conductive paint are painted on the wood which still works being underneath the sticker. The poster contains an illustrated 
										map of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia with various touchable point of interest (POI) as shown in the image above. When users touch the different POI and audio track regarding
										that POI will be played. We removed the projection component and added LED light strips and sound as feedback, making the interactive exhibit much smaller and easier 
										to operate by the ASPEC team without our assistance.

									<h3>University of Malaya Medical Center</h3>
									<p class="justified">
										In a freelance project I did shortly after my undergrad graduation for the University of Malaya Medical Center, I designed and developed a comprehensive Android 
										application called "Pain Diary". This tool was designed to assist caretakers of children with cerebral palsy in tracking daily symptoms and observations. It was meant to 
										simplify the doctors' appointment session by having the doctors understand what was going on in the past period of time rather than relying on what the caretaker remembers. 
										The intuitive interface and straightforward design of the app facilitate the easy logging of daily entries, creating a detailed, digital record of the child's condition.
									</p>
									<p class="justified">
										Through multiple interviews and meetings with key stakeholders (hospital staff and doctors), I meticulously gathered requirements and translated them into actionable design elements. The 
										initial prototypes were created in Adobe XD, ensuring the design was user-centric and intuitive for both caretakers and doctors. Once the prototype was refined 
										and approved, I developed the final application using Android Studio, delivering a functional tool that would enhance the communication between caretakers and 
										doctors during consultations. Although the Pain Diary app is just a prototype for research trial, it has streamlined the communication process between the caretakers and doctors.
